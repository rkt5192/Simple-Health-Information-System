# Simple-Health-Information-System
The objective of this study is to increase the number of people reached with health-related information, particularly related to COVID-19 outbreak management in humanitarian settings, through a mobilephone based Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. Traditional information dissemination processes, involving face-to-face information sessions, community meetings, and household visits, are infeasible in a pandemic environment. To date, the primary form of information dissemination in Rwandan refugee
camps is via broadcast media, such as radio and megaphones. This limits refugeesâ€™ ability to receive the specific information they desire and need. Working with colleagues in Rwanda, we examine: Can mobile phone voice-based health information diffusion contribute to information dissemination? Can a mobile phone-based system provide timelier and locally relevant information concerning COVID-19? 

Our goal is to address four specific objectives by the end of this project:
1. To develop a tool that can be deployed at low-cost on a mass scale to support refugee health
information and is inclusive of low-resource (no smartphone), low-literate (cannot read
pamphlets or SMS), and low-mobility (cannot travel due to lockdown or physical challenges)
populations.
2. To test the effectiveness of voice-based (or phone-call) health information services in the
refugee camp setting.
3. To collect and analyze usability data about and via a phone-based system.
4. To understand how refugees interact with an initial deployment of a phone call-based health
information system for COVID-related topics.
